# Contributing to NSLauncher Profile Generator

We would love for you to contribute to Launcher Runtime and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Commit Message Format](#commit)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github].
Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Format

### Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;
which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

---

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
---

<br />

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.


#### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: cargo)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
  A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
* **IMPORTANT CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `IMPORTANT CHANGE:`, or appends a `$` after the type/scope, introduces a important API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
  A IMPORTANT CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.


#### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
